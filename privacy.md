- Daily survey responses (yes/no answers, numerical values, scale ratings)
- Optional daily notes
- Streak tracking data

## Data Usage
- Data is used solely to provide habit tracking functionality within the app.
- All statistics, averages, and streak calculations are performed locally on device.

## Data Security
- Data is protected by your device’s built‑in security (passcode, Face ID, or Touch ID).
