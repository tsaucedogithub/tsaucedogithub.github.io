# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds two standalone policy pages to the Jekyll website for an app being built: a privacy policy page and a support policy page. These pages will be accessible via direct URLs but will not appear in the site navigation or be linked from other pages, making them "hidden" pages that can be accessed only when the specific URLs are known or shared. The pages will serve as policy documentation for the app rather than the main website.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an app developer, I want to add a privacy policy page to my Jekyll site, so that I can provide privacy information for my app when needed without cluttering my main website navigation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to `/privacy.html` THEN the system SHALL display a privacy policy page
2. WHEN the privacy policy page loads THEN the system SHALL render it using the site's standard layout and styling
3. WHEN a user views any other page on the site THEN the system SHALL NOT display any navigation links to the privacy policy page
4. WHEN the privacy policy page is generated THEN the system SHALL include it in the site build process

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an app developer, I want to add a support policy page to my Jekyll site, so that I can provide support information for my app when needed without cluttering my main website navigation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to `/support.html` THEN the system SHALL display a support policy page
2. WHEN the support policy page loads THEN the system SHALL render it using the site's standard layout and styling
3. WHEN a user views any other page on the site THEN the system SHALL NOT display any navigation links to the support policy page
4. WHEN the support policy page is generated THEN the system SHALL include it in the site build process

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want the policy pages to have consistent styling with the rest of the site, so that they feel like part of the same website experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a policy page loads THEN the system SHALL apply the same CSS styles as other pages
2. WHEN a policy page loads THEN the system SHALL use the same header and footer structure as other pages
3. WHEN a policy page loads THEN the system SHALL maintain the same visual design language as the rest of the site

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an app developer, I want the policy pages to be easily maintainable, so that I can update their app policy content without technical complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need to update policy content THEN the system SHALL allow me to edit standard Markdown files
2. WHEN I update policy content THEN the system SHALL automatically regenerate the pages during the next build
3. WHEN I create the policy pages THEN the system SHALL use Jekyll's standard page structure and front matter
