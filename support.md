## Getting Started
### Creating Your First Habit
1. Open the app and tap “Add Habit.”
2. Enter a name and select a type (binary, discrete, continuous).
3. Save to see it on your dashboard.

### Understanding Habit Types
- **Binary:** Yes/No habits (e.g., Meditated today?).
- **Discrete:** Count-based habits (e.g., Glasses of water).
- **Continuous:** Measurable values (e.g., Miles run).

### Taking Your First Daily Survey
1. Tap “Daily Survey” from the main menu.
2. Answer yes/no, select scales, or enter numbers.
3. Optionally add a note before submitting.

## Features Guide
- **Daily Survey:** Complete, edit, and review past survey entries.
- **Habit Management:** Add, edit, and delete habits anytime.
- **Streak Tracking:** Track daily and weekly streaks automatically.
- **Dashboard:** View your summary stats, calendar heatmap, and averages.
- **Notes:** Attach context or observations to any day’s entry.

## Troubleshooting
- **App Won’t Open:** Ensure iOS is updated; restart your device.
- **Data Missing:** Data is local—check device storage and backup settings.
- **Streaks Not Updating:** Confirm daily survey was submitted; streaks require consecutive entries.
