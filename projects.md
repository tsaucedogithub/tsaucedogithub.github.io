Here are some of my previous projects.

[CS229 Final Project, Autum 2022: Best Project award](https://github.com/tsaucedogithub/cs229_final_project)

We built & integrated multiple ML models to predict the genre of music and then the features of songs (think chroma and timbre) that comes next, live, and put it on an Arduino. Then, using what it thought would come next, the arduino would change the color of LED light strips like you find in every college student's dorm.


[My personal website (this site!)](https://github.com/tsaucedogithub/tsaucedogithub.github.io)

A personal site of mine! Do you like it? You know I built it myself, because there's no template that is this stylish (it's camp). I wanted to integrate all the things about me into one place, especially after [that youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyYQiMXcIxs&t=139s) blew up. Is that how you found me?


[Nature Paper on maladaptive mylenation and epilepsy](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-022-01052-2)

I worked in the [Knowles Lab](https://med.stanford.edu/pedsepilepsy-lab/team.html) where I helped run coherence models to understand how changes in mylenation effect epilepsy. I also mentored 4 undergrads, worked on mouse husbandry and colony planning, and wrote code in matlab to generate a vareity of figures and to mark EEG's. Figures 2 and 4 are my babies!
